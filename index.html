<h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
<h4> Rittwik Sood </h4>
<h4> Electrical Engineering PhD applicant - IIT Bombay </h4>

<p align="justify">
<p align="justify">Internet in India started with a wired broadband connection with all intertwined wires and slow
data rates. In a very short time, the world has achieved significantly high communication rates, that too
without the hassle of wires. I have been amazed by the shift of accomplishing communication without any
tangible medium, the current deployment of 5G networks and the planning of 6G networks. I strongly feel
that the applications of wireless communication networks will increase exponentially and be utilised for
society’s betterment in many more ways. I aspire to apply my research skills to develop innovative and
purposeful solutions to more problems in this technological field. Even though my undergraduate projects,
research internships, and research work at Qualcomm have given me ample experience, a PhD program at
the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay would help me expand my knowledge and explore the vast diversity of applications of Wireless Communication Systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Realising my propensity, I chose to do my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <i>National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur</i> (1). I found interest in subjects like Communication Theory, Wireless Networks, Digital Communication Systems, Spread-Spectrum, and I got A’s in all of them.</p>

<p align="justify"> I topped my branch (consisting of 94 students) and entire batch (700 students +) with a cumulative Grade Point of 9.72 on a scale of 10. <br>I was, therefore, conferred with the President of India Gold Medal for the batch 2014-2018. It is awarded to only 1 student from undergraduates, PGs and PhDs. I also got the Director’s Medal to Best All Rounder Performer for Batch 2018 across UG and PG for my overall excellent academic and co-curricular performance. </p>

<p align="justify"> In my sophomore year, I was awarded the coveted Summer Research Fellowship 2016 to undertake my internship at IIT Delhi (2) by the Indian Academy of Sciences (3). It is here, I first gained valuable insights into solving real-world problems. Just before the internship, an unfortunate incident took place with my college seniors. They went for a trek and were attacked by wild animals and could not be located for a couple of weeks. Trying to find an apposite solution to this problem, I made a prototype to geo-locate tourists and assist them in remote areas, devoid of Mobile communication. Proposed a Wireless Communication System with bluetooth, and a Mobile App interface to figure-out the last available coordinates of the user and, through data analysis, try to find the most probable radius according to the last registered coordinates. I was awarded the ’Best Intern Project’ for the same and wrote my first conference publication here (4). The
thrill of solving an authentic problem and the exposure to the research environment at this place prompted
me to drive abstract research problems and implement them in the practical world. </p>


<p align="justify"> In my pre-final year, I interned at IBT, KIT Germany (5), after getting selected for the prestigious DAAD-WISE Scholarship. I worked on the project ’Evaluation of methods for instantaneous phase detection on ECG, EEG signals’ under the tutelage of Prof. Olaf Dossel ¨ , Head of the Institute (6) and Dr. Nicolas Pilia. The challenges posed in this internship were far more complex and also related to a broader audience. The ask was to analyse the dataset containing early ECG and EEG signals of patients (who later encountered cardiac arrests, brain disorders and heart attacks) to identify these disorders well in time with precision. I decided to extract out the instantaneous phase of these signals to determine the probability of having a particular disorder in future. Firstly, I had to research about the existing techniques used for the same, but I could not find any, involving the instantaneous phase. I formulated a new model amalgamating the advantages of standard Signal Processing Transforms like Hilbert and STFT, and also more accurate and less time-complex than its counterparts. I subsequently mathematically compared my model with conventional techniques on diverse parameters (7). </p>

<p align="justify">The project gave me hands-on experience in advanced research and taught me how to proceed in solving real-life problems appropriately. Therefore, in the final year, my Major and Minor projects revolved around such pragmatic issues (8) involving Wireless Communication Systems and Signal Processing.</p>

<p align="justify">I wanted to enter the wireless industry to understand how research projects are actually commercialised. After being offered a full-time job at Qualcomm India, I joined the Modem WCDMA RF team. Within 6
months, I was moved to the newly formed NR5G team owing to my excellent performance in the earlier
team. I was the only ’Associate Engineer’ (junior-most role) in the team at that time. For the past 4 years, I
have worked in the Modem NR5G RF team on Physical Layer as a Senior Software NR5G Engineer and have
learnt a myriad of things in the field of Mobile Communication. My primary task is to develop features for
OEMs across the globe after analysing 3GPP spec documents. My work activities also include programming
HW components like Antennas, ADCs, LNAs, PowerAmps. I have worked immensely in 5G communication
(mmw technology), Air Interfaces and Embedded Systems. I have been awarded Orion Insta Award and
several Qualstars for my contributions towards the company (one of the highest awards) and have been
promoted twice in the last 3 years, well before time.</p>

<p align="justify"> My interest in doing a PhD intensified, even more, when I worked on a feature, ’NR Dual-Connectivity’
(FR1+FR2), for more than a year. I developed the entire framework from scratch from RF perspective, did the
initial research by reading 3GPP specs, made design documents, coded all the requirements and tested on
same. Qualcomm achieved a download speed of 10Gbps for the first time with NR-DC (9). I was appreciated
widely for this bring-up, and even Qualcomm CEO presented this feature as a highlight (amongst 5 features)
at Mobile World Congress, Barcelona, 2021 (10). While delving deeper into the problem statement, I experienced the excitement of going that last mile for the accuracy of the development, which I feel will come to
the fore as I go deeper into research. I have filed several IDFs (Invention Disclosure Forum’s) in the wireless domain and have a US patent in the process (MIMO processing). I also have a published Indian patent on an RF-based design of a Wireless Communication System, ’Real Time Smart Honking System'. </p>

<p align="justify">My prior work experiences and internships have given me insight into how subject knowledge and research
translate to practical applications. Thus, to further develop the skill of carving one’s technical expertise and
experience into a new world of innovations, I wish to pursue my PhD in Wireless Communication Networks.
The prospects of working in world-leading labs as a graduate student and being part of a vibrant research
community are one of the major driving forces behind my decision to apply to the PhD program inElectrical
Engineering at IIT Bombay.</p>

<p align="justify">With research interests inmmWave/MIMO Communication and 5G/NextG systems, I am inspired by the
specific works of Assistant Prof. Rajesh H. Zele in mmWave communication. It resonates with my interest
and prior experience, and I would love to work with him on similar research areas. I also find Associate Prof.
Kumar Appaiah’s work on 5G-MIMO and Associate Prof. Gaurav S Kasbekar’s work on Resource allocation
in millimeter Wave networks quite interesting. The prospect of working on Next Gen Wireless Communication Systems for future applications excites me. I would love to learn more and apply my past learnings in
Wireless Communication systems and NextG-technology to contribute to some of the ongoing projects in
IITB Wireless Communication Research groups.</p>

<p align="justify">I am confident that as an ensemble, my studies at IIT Bombay will put me on the path to becoming a better
researcher and support my goal of bringing an impact in society from Wireless Systems. I thus fervently hope
to get a positive reply about the admissions from you. </p>
